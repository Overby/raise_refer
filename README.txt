This site is intended to connect people in need of fundraising opportunities--Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, scholarship students, whomever--with a means of opening the door to affiliate marketing opportunities via a uniquely personalized campaign-specific code for each person/group. 

This way, someone making a regular purchase on a regular e-commerce site like Amazon or some other platform we're working with--can aid the stuent or Scout or whomever who is raising funds by referring to that individual the % of total the affiliate is set up to receive in that site's policy.


#Mostly, this is another chance to put skills to work and practice.
